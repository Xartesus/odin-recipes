      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>

      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>

      <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>

        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>
          Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Mix together the ground beef,
          garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper, and basil. Divide into four balls,
          and flatten into patties.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>
          Cook the patties for about 3 to 5 minutes on each side, or to desired
          doneness. The internal temperature should be at least 160 degrees F
          (70 degrees C). Remove from grill and place onto hamburger buns. Top
          with desired toppings and condiments.
