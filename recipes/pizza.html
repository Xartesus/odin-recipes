    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise.
      You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to
      go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Yeast: Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the
        ingredient that causes the pizza dough to rise.
      </li>

      <li>
        Sugar: To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water
        with a teaspoon of sugar. The sugar gives the yeast something to eat and
        speeds up the activation process. You'll know your yeast is active when
        it becomes bubbly and frothy on top.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bread Flour: Bread flour is ideal for pizza crust becauseit creates
        chewier results than all-purpose flour. This is because it contains more
        protein, which helps produce lots of gluten. Gluten is what gives the
        crust elasticity.
      </li>

      <li>
        Olive Oil: Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza
        crust: Not only does it add color and flavor, but it creates a barrier
        between the oil and water. This oily barrier prevents sogginess.
      </li>

      <li>
        Salt: A little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor,
        strengthens the gluten (creating a chewier crust), and slows down
        fermentation (resulting in a better rise).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Let the Dough Come to Room Temperature</h3>
        <p>
          After you're finished mixing the ingredients, allow your dough to rest
          on the counter for about 5 minutes. This will allow the gluten to
          relax, making the dough much easier to stretch and shape.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Prepare Your Surface With Oil</h3>
        <p>
          You might feel inclined to prep your workspace with a big handful of
          flour to prevent sticking. This is a helpful step with many kinds of
          dough. However, in this case, too much flour can make your pizza crust
          tough. Instead, rub your surface (and your hands) with a few
          tablespoons of olive oil and maybe a little bit of flour. This will
          prevent sticking, encourage a crispy texture, and ensure a gorgeous
          golden color.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Shape the Dough</h3>
        <p>
          You have a few options when it comes to shaping the dough. Stretch it
          in the air, use a rolling pin, or pat it with your hands. No matter
          which method you choose, make sure not to overwork the dough. Working
          it too much will create a tough texture. When you're done, you should
          have an even circle that's about 10 to 12 inches wide and about â…“-inch
          thick. If you get too thin, the crust may not be able to support the
          sauce and toppings.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Storing the Dough</h3>
        <p>
          This pizza dough will last for about five days in the fridge. Store it
          in an airtight storage container or a bowl tightly covered with
          storage wrap. Allow the refrigerated dough to sit for about 30 minutes
          at room temperature before using.
